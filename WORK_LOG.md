# goDB Work Log

## Current state

- Branch: `agent` (already active when this session began).
- Starting commit: `deb1cff` (`add README`).
- The worktree contained an untracked `AGENTS.md` supplied for this task; it has been preserved.
- No prior `WORK_LOG.md` existed.
- Baseline: `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./...` passed all packages; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go build ./...` passed. The first attempts without a temporary cache failed because `/home/rahul/.cache/go-build` is read only in this environment.

## Completed

### Reject malformed and oversized inserts before changing table state

- Priority: correctness and data integrity. `Table.Insert` previously advanced persisted ID metadata before validating value count, ignored `SetLastID` failures, and could allocate a page before discovering a row could never fit.
- Changes: validate value count and reject NUL bytes before reading or mutating storage; reject ID exhaustion and missing primary index; serialize once and reject rows larger than a page can hold; reserve the ID only after validation and propagate reservation failures; tombstone and flush a newly written row if primary-index insertion fails.
- Regression coverage: malformed, NUL-containing, and oversized inserts must leave the persisted ID and page count unchanged, and a subsequent valid insert must be retrievable by ID 0. A closed-index failure test verifies that an unindexed row stays invisible and the next successful insert uses the next ID. Test setup explicitly scopes `DATA_DIR` per test so tests do not reuse a deleted temporary directory.
- Verification on the final code: `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./internal/table` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go build ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go vet ./...` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Limitations: table writes are not transactional. A failure after writing the row or index can still leave components out of sync; WAL/recovery is a separate foundational task.
- Commit: `66dfb66` (`Harden table insert integrity`).

### Preserve row identity during variable-length updates

- Priority: correctness. The previous implementation called `Insert` with a full row, which prepended a second ID and failed arity validation; it also extended the iterator as it appended rows.
- Changes: collect the matched rows before mutation; preflight replacement capacity; repack page payloads while preserving slot IDs; relocate rows that do not fit and update the existing primary-index RID. Oversized values and invalid update columns are rejected before writes.
- Regression coverage: grow and shrink a multi-row table through both in-page replacement and relocation; verify row count, stable IDs, ID-index lookups, and reopen behavior. Oversized update leaves the original row unchanged. Pager test verifies repack slot preservation and no page mutation on `ErrPageFull`.
- Verification: `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./internal/pager ./internal/btree ./internal/table` passed; full `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go build ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go vet ./...` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Limitations: multi-row updates are preflighted for capacity and index locations, but are not crash-atomic if a later disk write fails. The engine still has no WAL or transaction recovery.
- Commit: `e8b5830` (`Preserve IDs in variable-length updates`).

### Treat deleted and missing ID lookups as empty results

- Priority: correctness. DELETE leaves the primary index pointing to a tombstoned slot, and `SELECT ... WHERE id=...` previously surfaced the tombstone as an invalid-slot error. Missing keys also returned a generic error rather than an empty result.
- Changes: pager reads now distinguish `ErrDeletedSlot` from `ErrInvalidSlot`; B+ tree lookups wrap `ErrKeyNotFound`; indexed table SELECT returns its header with no rows for a missing key or tombstone, while invalid slot RIDs still return an error.
- Regression coverage: select a deleted and absent ID and expect a header-only result; inject an invalid slot into the index and verify the corruption remains an error; B+ tree tests assert `errors.Is(..., ErrKeyNotFound)`.
- Verification: `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./internal/pager ./internal/btree ./internal/table` passed; full `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go build ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go vet ./...` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Limitation: DELETE still leaves the stale primary-index entry on disk; SELECT handles that tombstone, and the new validator reports it until physical index deletion is implemented.
- Commit: `f30adae` (`Handle deleted row ID lookups`).

### Add a primary-index consistency validator

- Priority: data-integrity diagnostics. Structural B+ tree validation alone cannot prove that leaf RIDs match stored rows or that every live table row is indexed.
- Changes: `Table.ValidatePrimaryIndex` runs structural validation, walks the leaf chain, verifies each entry points to a live row with the matching ID, and checks every live row maps back to its exact RID. It reports duplicate keys, missing entries, bad locations, mismatched IDs, and tombstoned index entries.
- Regression coverage: validation passes on a populated table and after row relocation/reopen; corrupted RIDs and stale entries after DELETE are rejected.
- Verification: `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./internal/table` passed; full `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go test ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go build ./...` passed; `GOCACHE=/tmp/goDB-gocache go vet ./...` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Limitation: this adds diagnosis, not physical B+ tree deletion. A table with deleted rows is expected to fail this strict consistency check until index deletion is implemented.

## Prioritized backlog

1. **Remove deleted rows from the primary B+ tree.** The new validator detects tombstoned RIDs, but DELETE still leaves them in the index. This depends on a safe B+ tree key deletion/rebalancing design. Acceptance: after delete, indexed lookup remains empty, the table/index validator passes, and delete/reopen cases cover leaf and internal-node boundaries.
2. **Add crash-safe table mutations.** Insert/update/delete write table pages, metadata, and indexes separately, so a process or I/O failure between writes can leave inconsistent state. Depends on a WAL or another recovery design. Acceptance: injected failures at each write boundary recover to a consistent table/index state across reopen.
3. **Validate and harden B+ tree file metadata and duplicate-key semantics.** Index open still trusts some root/page counts, and this branch does not specify duplicate handling. Acceptance: malformed/truncated metadata returns errors without panics; duplicate key behavior is explicit and tested.
4. **Add SQL/parser integration tests and usability documentation.** Parser/lexer lack test files, despite supporting CREATE/INSERT/SELECT/DELETE/UPDATE. Acceptance: representative valid and malformed statements are covered, including EOF and separator edge cases.
5. **Measure storage and index performance.** Existing insertion tests exercise large inputs but provide no benchmark baseline. Acceptance: add reproducible benchmarks for table insert/select and B+ tree insert/find before proposing optimization.

## Next action

Next task: implement B+ tree key deletion and primary-index maintenance for table DELETE, using the validator to prove consistency before and after reopen. Preserve the supplied untracked `AGENTS.md`.
